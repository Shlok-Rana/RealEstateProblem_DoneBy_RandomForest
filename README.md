# RealEstateProblem_DoneBy_RandomForest
This project is based on the Real Estates problem, my model predict the price of the houses and trained on the famous boston house dataset. I have compare all the possible machine learning algorithms to predict the price but the best one is Random Forest Regressor, so I choose this model to predict the price of the houses. In this project I have also done all the feature engeneering part like making the pipeline, understand the correlation matrix spliting done by stratified split function etc.
